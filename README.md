Official Findologic plugin for Shopware 6.

## Installation

### Production

Please see [our Shopware 6 documentation](https://docs.findologic.com/doku.php?id=integration_documentation:plugin:en:integration:shopware_6).

### Development

1. Set up the [Shopware 6 development template](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/installation/docker)
2. Navigate to the plugins folder
   ```bash
   cd custom/plugins
   ```
3. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:findologic/plugin-shopware-6.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   cd plugin-shopware-6 && composer install
   ```
5. Navigate back to the development template root
   ```bash
   cd ../../..
   ```
6. Run Shopware if not already done
   ```bash
   ./psh.phar docker:start
   ```
7. SSH into the Shopware docker container
   ```bash
   ./psh.phar docker:ssh
   ```
8. Install and activate the plugin
   ```bash
   bin/console plugin:install FinSearch --activate --clearCache
   ```

### Run PHPUnit tests

#### Prerequisites

* MySQL >= 8.0
* PHP >= 7.3

#### Setup

1. Create a database user `app` with the password `app`, which should have permissions to create,
   update and delete all databases.
2. In the development templates root, initialize the test setup (run locally, outside the app container)
   ```bash
   ./psh.phar init
   ```
3. Navigate to the plugin and run tests
   ```bash
   cd custom/plugins/plugin-shopware-6 && composer test
   ```

Tests can also be run separately within the IDE. Simply ensure to set `phpunit.xml.dist` as configuration file.

### Developing custom JavaScript plugins

- Check out the
  [offical guide](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/how-to/extend-core-js-storefront-plugin)
  on how to extend js storefront plugin.
- Create your plugin files inside
  `src/Resources/app/storefront/src/js/[your-plugin-name].plugin.js`
- [Register your extended plugin](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-platform-dev-en/how-to/extend-core-js-storefront-plugin#register-your-extended-plugin)
- For a development build: `./psh.phar storefront:dev`
- For a production build: `./psh.phar storefront:build`

**Please note:**

* The build commands will create a minified JS file in `src/Resources/app/storefront/dist/storefront/js/[plugin-name].js`.
* Before committing ensure that all files were built and added to your commit.
* Make sure to also commit the minified JavaScript files.

## Libraries

We are using some of our libraries that are especially relevant for this and other plugins.
Note that these libraries already come with the plugin itself, so you do not need to
install them yourself.

* [findologic/libflexport](https://github.com/findologic/libflexport) Helps generating
 the shop's data feed aka. export. We use it to generate an XML based on the product data
 of the shop.
* [findologic/findologic-api](https://github.com/findologic/findologic-api) Handles requests
 to FINDOLOGIC. This includes everything from sending query parameters like selected filters,
 output attributes, to parsing the response with response objects.

## Export customization

In some cases you may want to export additional, custom export data. To still provide you
plugin updates, we have an extension plugin. It overrides logic of the base plugin to reflect
your own logic.

Use the [FINDOLOGIC Shopware 6 extension plugin](https://github.com/findologic/plugin-shopware-6-extension) to customize your export. There are already pre-defined examples, that
guide you on how you can customize certain entities, like attributes or properties.

## Deployment and Release
Before starting the deployment make sure that a release is already created.

1. Run `git fetch` and ensure that the release tag is available locally. Make sure
 that the file `composer.json` contains the correct version constraint.
1. Run `composer release`, which will build a release `FinSearch-x.x.x.zip` file.
1. Upload this version to Google Drive `Development/Plugins/Shopware/Shopware 6 DI & API Plugin` and move the old
 version to `alte Versionen`.
1. Go to https://account.shopware.com and login. Go to
 `Manufacturer area > Plugins > Shopware 6 plugins > FINDOLOGIC Search & Navigation` and select *Versions*. Click
 on *Upload new version* and fill out all necessary fields. In the second step mark the plugin as compatible
 for Shopware 6.0 and newer. Last but not least upload the plugins' zip file and mark all
 required checkboxes.
1. Once the release is available require an *automatic code review*.
1. Notify everyone at Basecamp that the new release is available.

## Test Shopware release candidates

1. Access the application container
  ```bash
  ./psh.phar docker:ssh
  ```
2. Use the branch for the next release
  ```bash
  composer require shopware/platform:6.x.x.x-dev
  ```
3. Clear cache
  ```bash
  ./psh.phar cache
  ```
4. Execute install script
  ```bash
  ./psh.phar install
  ```
